# Connect Saas documentation

## Introduction
Connect uses a microservice solution, if not specified, it is written in C#:
+ Web service/file storage uses AWS S3
+ Basically each service has its own separate PostgreSQL database
+ Use Redis for distributed cache
+ Use RabbitMQ for messaging between services.
+ Use Docker to deploy & run all services and applications.
+ Use Keycloak as SSO
+ Use Business Event Log to record server-side logs
+ Use Entity Store to save campaign information
+ [Message Server](###message-server) is used to process the logic of sending messages to WhatApp regularly/instantly, and update the status of the activity according to the status of the message sent
+ [Facebook Server](###facebook-server) as the server side of Facebook App, acting as a chatbot
+ [WhatsApp server](###whatsapp-server) is used to send messages to WhatsApp users and accept WhatsApp webhook to update the sending status
+ [Leads server](###leads-server) currently only saves the personal information of Leads from campaigns, and can tag Leads. After sending a WhatsApp message, the recipientâ€™s personal information is saved here as Leads
+ The data analytics server is written in Python. Regularly run scripts to fetch data from the database of each service, generate the required report data after processing, or run some timing tasks: such as tagging the specified Leads, generating excel reports based on the data and sending files to user's email or SFTP. There is no complicated logic, Just some data query and then processed script
+ [Report Server](###report-server) is used to provide various graphical data queries of reports. The report data is the data after the data analytics server script is run.
+ [Media Server](###media-server) is used to manage the pictures/video/audio files uploaded by users. It is designed to be charged according to the storage size. Currently, there is no charge. Need to move/delete files in bulk
+ [custom campaign Server](###custom-campaign-server) allows users to design static web pages that can be directly sent to users to browse various content without any code. It may be necessary to guide users to log in and record user behaviors to obtain users portrait
+ [File upload service](###file-upload-service) is used to allow users to upload picture/video/audio files to S3 of AWS, after uploading to provide public browsing, the file size may reach 2G.And CDN may be needed.
+ [Tiktok Service](###tiktok-server) is used to manage the videos used by Tiktok and needs some webhook APIs.

The following figure shows the system:
